Rip Rip Hooray! is a specialized audio CD-ripper optimized for track recovery.

It doesn't beat a drive senseless every time a read error is encountered; it simply notes the problem and moves on. Its iterative design allows it to grab what it can, as it can, progressively filling in the gaps from run-to-run.

Between those runs — which typically only last a few minutes — you can actually _do things_. You can inspect the disc, give it another clean, switch drives, shut down your computer and go to bed, or check to see the rip is already _good enough_ for [CUETools repair](http://cue.tools/wiki/CUETools_Database) to automatically finish.

Total recovery is not always possible, but Rip Rip Hooray! will rescue more data than traditional CD-ripping software, more accurately, and in significantly less time.



## Features

Iteration is key. Individual Rip Rip rips take minutes intead of hours or days, getting you access to the recovered data — regardless of "completeness" — as quickly as possible. You can re-run Rip Rip at any time, as many times as you want, with as many different optical drives as you want, to retry the outstanding regions and refine the data.

Beyond that, it supports all the good things:

* C2 error pointers
* Drive read offset auto-detection
* Drive read offset correction
* [AccurateRip](http://accuraterip.com/) checksum verification
* [CUETools](http://cue.tools/wiki/CUETools_Database) checksum verification
* Cache busting
* Sample re/confirmation
* Raw PCM and WAV output

Rip Rip Hooray! does not aspire to manage your media library, so doesn't muck about with track metadata, format conversion, album art, etc. But it does print a nice little summary of the disc's table of contents and its various identifiers:

* [AccurateRip](http://accuraterip.com/) ID
* [CDDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDDB) ID
* [CUETools](http://cue.tools/wiki/CUETools_Database) ID
* [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) ID
* Track ISRCs (if present)
* UPC/EAN (if present)

That summary can be produced on its own using the `--no-rip` flag.



## Limitations and Workarounds

Rip Rip Hooray!, like any other CD-ripping tool, ultimately depends on the optical drive to decode and deliver the requested data, or at be accurate about the inaccuracies.

When the drive can't live up to its end for whatever reason, the resulting rip will be incomplete or inaccurate. It might still be _good enough_ for [CUETools repair](http://cue.tools/wiki/CUETools_Database), though, so be sure to give that a try.

Otherwise, consider:

* Re-ripping the content with the `--reconfirm` flag
* Re-ripping the content with the `--reconfirm` flag _and_ a different drive
* Restarting the rip with a different drive

If you don't have a second drive or it didn't help, physical resurfacing might restore readability. Video game stores will typically do this for a few bucks per disc, but before you start calling around, make sure there is actually wear-and-tear. If instead you see discoloration, transparency, and/or tiny white spots, those symptoms are terminal; the disc itself is dying and will need to be replaced.



## Tracks, Logs, and State Data

Rip Rip Hooray! will need to create a number of different files in addition to the ripped tracks themselves. To keep things tidy, it saves everything to a subfolder within the current working directory called `_riprip`.

To resume a rip, just rerun the program from the same place and it will automatically pick up from where it left off.

When you're completely done ripping a given disc — and have moved or converted the exported tracks — delete the `_riprip` folder to reclaim the disk space. ;)



## Installation

Debian and Ubuntu users can just grab the pre-built `.deb` package from the [release](https://github.com/Blobfolio/riprip/releases) page.

While specifically written for use on x86-64 Linux systems, both Rust and [libcdio](https://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/) are cross-platform, so you may well be able to build it from source on other 64-bit Unix systems using `cargo`:

```bash
# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Blobfolio/riprip

# The libcdio development headers are required when building from source;
# Debian/Ubuntu users, for example, could run the following:
sudo apt-get install libcdio-dev

# Run Cargo build from the project root:
cd riprip
cargo build --release
```
