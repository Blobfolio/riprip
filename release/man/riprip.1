.SH NAME
Rip Rip Hooray! \- Manual page for riprip v0.0.8.
.SH DESCRIPTION
A specialized audio CD\-ripper optimized for incremental data recovery.
.SS USAGE:
.TP
riprip [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]
.SS FLAGS:
.TP
\fB\-\-backwards\fR
Rip sectors in reverse order. (Data will still be saved in the *correct* order. Haha.)
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help information.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-c2\fR
Disable/ignore C2 error pointer information when ripping, e.g. for drives that do not support the feature. (This flag is otherwise not recommended.)
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-cache\-bust\fR
Do not attempt to reset the optical drive cache between each rip pass.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-resume\fR
Ignore any previous rip states; start over from scratch.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-rip\fR
Print the basic drive and disc information to STDERR and exit (without ripping anything).
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-summary\fR
Skip the drive and disc summary and jump straight to ripping.
.TP
\fB\-\-raw\fR
Save ripped tracks in raw PCM format (instead of WAV).
.TP
\fB\-\-strict\fR
Treat C2 errors as an all\-or\-nothing proposition for the sector as a whole rather than judging each individual sample on its own.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print program version.
.SS OPTIONS:
.TP
\fB\-\-confidence\fR <NUM>
Consider a track accurately ripped — i.e. stop working on it — AccurateRip and/or CUETools matches are found with a confidence of at least <NUM>. [default: 3; range: 3..=10]
.TP
\fB\-\-cutoff\fR <NUM>
Consider allegedly\-good samples 'likely' once the same value has been read at least <NUM> times and twice as often as any competing values. Sectors containing only likely/confirmed samples are skipped during subsequent passes, so the lower the cutoff, the faster they'll go. Higher values are recommended for wishywashy drives. [default: 2; range: 1..=32]
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dev\fR <PATH>
The device path for the optical drive containing the CD of interest, like /dev/cdrom. [default: auto]
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-offset\fR <SAMPLES>
The AccurateRip, et al, sample read offset to apply to data retrieved from the drive. [default: auto or 0; range: ±5880]
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-refine\fR <NUM>
Automatically execute up to <NUM> additional rip passes for each track while any samples remain unread or unconfirmed. [default: 1; max: 32]
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-track\fR <NUM>
Rip one or more specific tracks (rather than the whole disc). Multiple tracks can be separated by commas (2,3), specified as an inclusive range (2\-3), and/or given their own \-t/\-\-track (\-t 2 \-t 3). [default: the whole disc]
